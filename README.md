# Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter Data

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data using three machine learning models- namely naive bias,svm,logistic regression. The aim is to classify tweets into positive, negative,sentiments.

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool in understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and social media trends. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze Twitter data and predict the sentiment of tweets.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Collects tweets using the Twitter API.[Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets from kaggle]
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the text data, including steps like tokenization,stemming, lemmatization, and removing stopwords.
- **Model Training**: Implements and trains various machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Linear Regression.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the models and compares their accuracy.
